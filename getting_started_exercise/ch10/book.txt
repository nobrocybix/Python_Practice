	"The Odyssey" by Homer is an epic poem attributed to the ancient Greek poet, believed to have been composed in the late 8th century BC. This foundational work of Western literature chronicles the adventures of Odysseus, a clever hero whose journey home following the Trojan War is fraught with peril, delays, and divine intervention. The central narrative follows Odysseus' attempts to return to his wife, Penelope, and son, Telemachus, while grappling with the challenges posed by suitors in his absence. The opening portion of "The Odyssey" sets the stage for the epic tale by introducing the plight of its hero, Odysseus, who is trapped on the island of Ogygia by the goddess Calypso as he longs to return to Ithaca. The narrative begins with a divine council at Olympus, where the gods discuss Odysseus's fate, revealing their sympathy for him, especially from Athena. It quickly shifts to Ithaca, where Telemachus grapples with his father's absence and the disrespectful suitors devouring his household. Prompted by Athena, he resolves to seek news of Odysseus, embarking on a quest that propels him into a broader world of heroism, fate, and familial loyalty.
